Description:

Our project aims to develop a sophisticated system that automates the prediction of loan eligibility and default based on customer-provided details. To accomplish this, we will use the power of machine learning techniques, leveraging Python with its data manipulation library, pandas, and employing Tableau for data analysis and visualization of the dataset. By combining these technologies, we strive to create a robust and insightful platform for loan evaluation and decision-making.

Questions:

What are the largest predictors of loan approval?
How much does education predict loan approval?
Is there any correlation between loan amount and length in terms of approval?
Does applicant income directly correlate with loan amount?

Predictions:

We predict that the greatest indicators of approval are the relation of income to loan amount, and credit history.

Result:

We were correct that one of the greatest indicators was the income to loan amount. In fact the greatest indicators were the loan percent of income, loan interest rate, income of person, and loan amount in that order.

Our website serves as a valuable tool for both banks and borrowers. It empowers banks by enhancing their loan assessment capabilities, while borrowers can gain insights into the key metrics they can modify to increase their chances of obtaining a loan.
