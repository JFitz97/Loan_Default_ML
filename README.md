Description:

For our project, we want to create a system that automatically predicts the eligibility/default of a loan based on customer provided details. We plan to use machine learning, python/pandas, and tableau to analyze and visualize the dataset.

Questions:

What are the largest predictors of loan approval?
How much does education predict loan approval?
Is there any correlation between loan amount and length in terms of approval?
Does applicant income directly correlate with loan amount?

Predictions:

We predict that the greatest indicators of approval are the relation of income to loan amount, and credit history.
